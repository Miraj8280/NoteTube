# NoteTube

NoteTube is a responsive video player application built with React.js using Vite as the build tool. It allows users to play any YouTube video and add notes linked to specific timestamps in the video. The application utilizes local storage to save notes, ensuring that notes are tied to the corresponding video ID even when the video is changed.
